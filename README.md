## Project Overview

This project explores mortality outcomes using the Aortic Valve Stenosis (AVS) dataset. The focus is on uncovering relationships between clinical indicators and patient outcomes, with the goal of identifying predictive factors for mortality risk.

Key tools and techniques include:

- Real-world medical data analysis  
- Statistical modeling and machine learning  
- Python for data preprocessing and visualization  
- R for extended statistical analysis  

---

## Data Description

The dataset includes:

- **Demographics** (e.g., age, sex)  
- **Clinical measurements** (e.g., cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine)  
- **Comorbid conditions and medications**  
- **Outcomes** (e.g., survival or mortality)  

- [A new machine learning-based prediction model for subtype diagnosis in primary aldosteronism (NCBI)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9728523/#SM1)
- [Aldosterone reduction rate after saline infusion may be a novel clinical prediction of determining subtypes of primary aldosteronism](https://datadryad.org)

All data is stored  in the `data/` directory.  
No external downloads or setup scripts are required — the data is included in the repository.
