## Project Overview

This project explores Primary Aldosteronism Subtypes using a medical dataset. The focus is on uncovering relationships between clinical indicators and patient outcomes, with the goal of identifying predictive factors for subtype classification.

Key tools and techniques include:

- Real-world medical data analysis  
- Statistical modeling and machine learning  
- Python for data preprocessing and visualization  

---

## Data Description

The dataset includes:

- **Demographics** (e.g., age, sex)  
- **Clinical measurements** (e.g., hormone levels, blood pressure)  
- **Comorbid conditions and medications**  
- **Outcomes** (e.g., subtype classification)

- [Aldosterone reduction rate after saline infusion may be a novel clinical prediction of determining subtypes of primary aldosteronism](https://datadryad.org)

All data is stored  in the `data/` directory.  
No external downloads or setup scripts are required — the data is included in the repository.
